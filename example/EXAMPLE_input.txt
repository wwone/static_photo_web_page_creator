Grand Canyon
(previous title text is bold, this is not...) Taken at sunset. <br/><br/>This narrative MUST BE a single line, so be prepared to wrap. This line will be embedded in the web page without much ado, so you can put HTML into it without much trouble. <a href='http://google.com'>Google</a> is an example.<br/><br/>New line here, no problem.<br/><br/>Two lines follow in the 'input.txt' file. First is the URL of the thumbnail that appears on the page. To keep the page readable, thumbs should be 400-600 pixels wide. If the thumb image is too big, no problem. The URL is enclosed in single quotes, so just terminate the URL with a single quote, then add something like " width='400". Ignore the double quotes here, I'm just trying to explain. DO NOT terminate the width amount with a single quote, the Java does that for you. Same can be done for specifying an 'id=' tag, which then allows you to navigate through the web page using local links.<br/><br/>4th line of this grouping is the URL of the larger picture. A simple hyperlink jump is supplied for it. Ideally, it is good to create both full-sized photos/images and thumbnail-sized. Use the 'ImageMagick' program to execute bulk resizing.
