# static_photo_web_page_creator
This static HTML file creator is an upgrade to the Perl code that I have here on GitHub. 

This creator is written in Java and uses only two files for input, rather than the additional items used by the Perl code. 

This code creates more up-to-date web pages, invoking a more recent version of the Vanilla layout. 

Boilerplate for the pages is kept in a JSON file, allowing for more flexibility in design, and use of alternative designs.

For the purposes of showcasing photos, it invokes a Vanilla dark-themed background.
